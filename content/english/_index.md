# robotics course and practical work

ROS4PRO is a set of resources for learning open-source robotics with the [ROS] framework (http://ros.org) which will equip more than half of the robots sold in 2024. You can freely follow them, duplicate them and enrich them then [share your improvements] (https://github.com/ros4pro/learn).

## How to follow the practical work ?

ü§ñ It is likely that you will take this practical work as part of a course that provides you with robotic equipment. Depending on your equipment, several learning pathes are available below. If you have no equipment, some pathes can be partially followed in simulation.

üíª You must have a PC type computer as well as [Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic] (http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) installed.

üìÄ To follow the learning pathes without having to install ROS and the dependencies yourself, you can download [this Live USB stick] (https://files.ros4.pro/ubuntu.img.7z) and [follow the instructions of flash] (https://files.ros4.pro/boot.pdf).

## Learning pathes

### Path #1 : Poppy Ergo Jr + tensorflow2 + Turtlebot (possible partially in simulation)
1. [Introduction]  (introduction/)
2. [Navigation] (navigation/turtlebot/)
3. [Manipulation] (manipulation/ergo-jr/)
4. [Vision](vision/classification_tf2/)
5. [Int√©gration] (integration/ergo-tb-keras/)

### Path #2 : Sawyer + tensorflow2 + Turtlebot
1. [Introduction] (introduction/)
2. [Navigation] (navigation/turtlebot/)
3. [Manipulation] (manipulation/sawyer/)
4. [Vision] (vision/classification_tf2/)
5. [Int√©gration] (integration/sawyer-tb-keras/)

## Legend
The following pictograms are used:

* üíª: Procedure to run on your Ubuntu workstation
* ü§ñ: Procedure to be performed on the robot, using SSH
* üìÄ: This procedure is already done for you if you launch Ubuntu via a Live USB key
* üêç: Python code to save and run on your workstation
* üì•: Resource to Download
* ‚úç: Answer questions in writing
