Within this page `numpy` is supposed to be imported as:
```python
>>> import numpy as np
```

### shape

the attribute `shape` of an ndarray object return its shape as a tuple:

```python
>>> V = np.array([1,2,3])
>>> V.shape
(3,)                                       # (3) is a scalar but (3,) is a tuple!
>>> V = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
>>> V.shape
(2, 3)
```

## argmax

the method `argmax` returns the rank of the max value in the ndarray:

```python
>>> V = np.array([1,1,1,100,1])
>>> V.max()
100
>>> V.argmax()
3
>>> V[V.argmax()]
100
```
